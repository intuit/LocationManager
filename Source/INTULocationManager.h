/**
 An abstraction around CLLocationManager that provides a block-based asynchronous API for obtaining the device's location.
 
 This class will automatically start and stop location services as needed to conserve battery. As a result, this class should
 not be used in combination with any other code that directly uses the -[CLLocationManager startUpdatingLocation] or
 -[CLLocationManager stopUpdatingLocation] methods.
