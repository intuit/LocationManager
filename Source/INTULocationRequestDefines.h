 A block type for a location request, which is executed when the request succeeds, fails, or times out.

 @param achievedAccuracy The accuracy level that was actually achieved (may be better than, equal to, or worse than the desired accuracy).
 @param status The status of the location request - whether it succeeded, timed out, or failed due to some sort of error. This can be used to
               understand what the outcome of the request was, decide if/how to use the associated currentLocation, and determine whether other
