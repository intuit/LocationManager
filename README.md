# INTULocationManager
INTULocationManager makes it easy to get the device's current location on iOS.

INTULocationManager provides a block-based asynchronous API to request the current location. It internally manages multiple simultaneous location requests, and each request specifies its own desired accuracy level and timeout duration. INTULocationManager automatically starts location services when the first request comes in, and stops location services once all requests have been completed.

## What's wrong with CLLocationManager?
The CLLocationManager API works best when you need to track changes in the user's location over time, such as for turn-by-turn GPS navigation apps. However, if you just need to ask "Where am I?" every now and then, CLLocationManager is fairly difficult to work with. Getting these one-off location updates is a common task for many apps, such as when you want to autofill an address from the current location, or determine which city the user is currently in.

INTULocationManager makes it easy to request the device's current location, with a single API method that allows you to specify how accurate of a location you need, and how long you're willing to wait to get it. INTULocationManager is power efficient and conserves the user's battery by powering down location services (e.g. GPS) as soon as they are no longer needed.

## Usage
**Important:** Because `INTULocationManager` automatically starts & stops location updates, make sure not to use any other code that starts or stops location updates on `CLLocationManager` directly.

### Getting the Current Location
To get the device's current location, use the method `requestLocationWithDesiredAccuracy:timeout:block:`.

The `desiredAccuracy` parameter specifies how **accurate and recent** of a location you need. The possible values are:
```objective-c
INTULocationAccuracyCity          // 5000 meters or better, received within the last 10 minutes  -- lowest accuracy
INTULocationAccuracyNeighborhood  // 1000 meters or better, received within the last 5 minutes
INTULocationAccuracyBlock         // 100 meters or better, received within the last 1 minute
INTULocationAccuracyHouse         // 15 meters or better, received within the last 15 seconds
INTULocationAccuracyRoom          // 5 meters or better, received within the last 5 seconds      -- highest accuracy
```

The `timeout` parameter specifies how long you are willing to wait for a location with the accuracy you requested. The timeout guarantees that your block will execute within this period of time, either with a location of at least the accuracy you requested (`INTULocationStatusSuccess`), or with whatever location could be determined before the timeout interval was up (`INTULocationStatusTimedOut`). Pass `0.0` for no timeout *(not recommended)*.

The `deferFirstRequestTimeout` parameter specifies to defer first location request, when the user has not yet decided to allow or deny location services for app. Pass `YES` to start `timeout` timer.

Here's an example:
```objective-c
INTULocationManager *locMgr = [INTULocationManager sharedInstance];
[locMgr requestLocationWithDesiredAccuracy:INTULocationAccuracyCity
                                   timeout:10.0
                  deferFirstRequestTimeout:YES
                                     block:^(CLLocation *currentLocation, INTULocationAccuracy achievedAccuracy, INTULocationStatus status) {
                                         if (status == INTULocationStatusSuccess) {
                                             // Request succeeded, meaning achievedAccuracy is at least the requested accuracy, and
                                             // currentLocation contains the device's current location.
                                         }
                                         else if (status == INTULocationStatusTimedOut) {
                                             // Wasn't able to locate the user with the requested accuracy within the timeout interval.
                                             // However, currentLocation contains the best location available (if any) as of right now,
                                             // and achievedAccuracy has info on the accuracy/recency of the location in currentLocation.
                                         }
                                         else {
                                             // An error occurred, more info is available by looking at the specific status returned.
                                         }
                                     }];
```

### Managing In-Progress Requests
When issuing a location request, you can optionally store the request ID, which allows you to force completion or cancel the request at any time:
```objective-c
NSInteger requestID = [[INTULocationManager sharedInstance] requestLocationWithDesiredAccuracy:INTULocationAccuracyHouse
                                                                                       timeout:5.0
                                                                      deferFirstRequestTimeout:YES
                                                                                         block:locationRequestBlock];

// Force the request to complete early, like a manual timeout (will execute the block)
[[INTULocationManager sharedInstance] forceCompleteLocationRequest:requestID];

// Cancel the request (won't execute the block)
[[INTULocationManager sharedInstance] cancelLocationRequest:requestID];
```
