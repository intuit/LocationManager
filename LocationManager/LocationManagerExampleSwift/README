This is a "working" example of the LocationManager library ported to swift from the original Objective-c example

You'll need to install the LocationManager framework. 
I used Carthage when I tested it out, but have not included the Carthage path in this folder.
Once you install the framework, you'll need to go to MyProject > General > Embedded Binaries and add the framework
